The Pomodoro technique is a simple yet effective tool for focused work with planned breaks in between.<br>
So, how does it work? Let‚Äôs break down a pomodoro interval step by step:
<br>

+ We set time work to 25 minutes and start
+ Passing 25 minutes in the clock and we take a five-minutos break
+ Take longer breaks (10 minutes) for every four pomodoro intervals

<h2>Prerequisits</h2>


 Before you can start coding, you need to have five things:
+ A Discord account
+ A Discord server that you have enough access to, so you can connect bots
+ A Discord application
+ Permissions granted for that server so that bot is able to read and write messages there
<br>
Second you can create in discord.com. The rest you can create in https://discord.com/developers/applications
<br>

Create a file .env text with content
<br><br>
<code>BOT_TOKEN=PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE </code>
<br>
 And finally run the __ init __.py with a idle.
